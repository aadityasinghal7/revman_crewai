extract_effective_date:
  description: |
    Extract the effective date from the input Excel filename to determine when the price changes take effect.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Input: {excel_file_path} (the path to the Excel file)
    - Use the DateExtractorTool to parse the filename and extract the date
    - Expected filename pattern: "TBS Price Change Summary Report - October 13th'25.xlsx"
    - The tool will extract the date portion (e.g., "October 13th'25") and parse it to:
      * ISO format: "2025-10-13" (for internal use)
      * Display format: "October 13, 2025" (for email subject and body)
    - If date extraction fails, the tool will fallback to current date

    This date represents when the price changes become effective (NOT when the flow runs).
    It will be used in the email subject line and body.

  expected_output: |
    A JSON response containing:
    - success: true/false
    - source: "filename" (or "fallback"/"error")
    - effective_date_iso: "2025-10-13" (ISO format YYYY-MM-DD)
    - effective_date_display: "October 13, 2025" (human-readable format)
    - message: Success or error message

    Example:
    {{
      "success": true,
      "source": "filename",
      "filename": "TBS Price Change Summary Report - October 13th'25_formula.xlsx",
      "effective_date_iso": "2025-10-13",
      "effective_date_display": "October 13, 2025",
      "raw_date_string": "October 13th'25",
      "message": "Successfully extracted date: October 13, 2025"
    }}

generate_formula_excel:
  description: |
    Generate a copy of the input Excel file with formulas added to calculate formatted price change text.

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    - Input: {excel_file_path} (the path to the original Excel file)
    - Output directory: {output_dir} (where to save the formula Excel file)
    - Use the FormulaExcelGeneratorTool to create the Excel file with formulas
    - The formula should be: =PROPER($D[ROW])&" "&$H[ROW]&$L[ROW]&" "&$M[ROW]&"$"&ABS($K[ROW])&" to $"&$J[ROW]
      where [ROW] represents the actual row number (9, 10, 11, etc.)
    - Formula is added to column N for each data row
    - Skip first 7 rows, row 8 has headers, row 9 is the first data row
    - Output filename should follow pattern: "TBS Price Change Summary Report - [Month] [day]th'[YY]_formula.xlsx"
    - The tool will automatically extract the month/date from the input filename
    - Save to the output directory specified

    This creates a version of the Excel file that Mark can open to see the formatted price changes,
    matching his manual workflow of applying formulas in Excel.

  expected_output: |
    A JSON response containing:
    - success: true/false
    - output_file: Full path to the generated Excel file with formulas
    - output_filename: Just the filename of the generated file
    - formulas_added: Count of how many formula rows were added
    - message: Success message with details

    Example:
    {{
      "success": true,
      "output_file": "C:/path/to/output/TBS Price Change Summary Report - October 13th'25_formula.xlsx",
      "output_filename": "TBS Price Change Summary Report - October 13th'25_formula.xlsx",
      "formulas_added": 150,
      "message": "Successfully created formula Excel file with 150 formulas"
    }}

analyze_price_changes:
  description: |
    Analyze and categorize price change data for highlights email using the 6-category system.

    DATA SOURCE:
    - Use the parsed data from the parse_excel_file task (available via context)
    - DO NOT read the Excel file again - all data has already been parsed and is available
    - All product records with complete column data are available from the previous task

    BREWER HIERARCHY AND BRAND MAPPING:
    Map individual brands to their parent brewers using this hierarchy:
    - LABATT: Includes Budweiser, Bud Light, Stella Artois, Corona, Modelo, Becks, Hoegaarden, Michelob, etc.
    - MOLSON: Includes Coors, Molson Canadian, Miller, Heineken, etc.
    - SLEEMAN: Includes Sleeman products, Sapporo, etc.
    - Other: Includes Laker, Peroni, James Ready, Moosehead, Guinness, and any brands not in above categories

    CATEGORIZATION PROCESS:

    FOR EACH PRODUCT, categorize in this order (first match wins):

    1. LICENSEE CHANGES (FIRST PRIORITY):
       - If Type of Sale = "TBS - Licensee" → Add to "LICENSEE CHANGES" category
       - Format: "Product PackSize +/-$X.XX to $YY.YY"
       - ALL licensee products go here, regardless of brewer

    2. NEW SKUs:
       - If marked as New SKU → Add to "NEW SKUs" category
       - Format: "Product PackSize $YY.YY"

    3. RETAIL PRODUCTS (Type of Sale = "TBS – Retail Price"):
       - First, assign to parent brewer (LABATT, MOLSON, SLEEMAN, or Other) using hierarchy above
       - Then categorize by price change using ±4% threshold:
         * Calculate: price_ratio = new_price / old_price
         * If price_ratio < 0.96: "Begin LTO"
         * If price_ratio > 1.04: "End LTO" (or "End LTO & Permanent Change" if price doesn't return to pre-LTO)
         * If 0.96 ≤ price_ratio ≤ 1.04: "Permanent Changes"
       - Format: "Product PackSize +/-$X.XX to $YY.YY"

    CRITICAL: Process ALL licensee products (Type of Sale = "TBS - Licensee") into the "LICENSEE CHANGES" category BEFORE assigning any products to brewers.
