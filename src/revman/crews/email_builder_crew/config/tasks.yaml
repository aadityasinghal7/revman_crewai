    Transform the categorized price change data into the standard "Highlights" email format.

    REQUIRED STRUCTURE:
    1. Title: "Highlights (Price Before Tax and Deposit)"
    2. For each Brewer (LABATT, MOLSON, SLEEMAN, etc.):
       - Brewer name as header
       - "Begin LTO" section with price decreases
       - "End LTO" section with price increases
       - "End LTO & Perm Change" section (if applicable)
       - "Permanent Changes" section (if applicable)
       - Empty line between brewers

    FORMAT EACH LINE:
    Product PackSize +/-$Amount to $FinalPrice (optional context)

    Examples:
    - "Budweiser 30C -$5.50 to $45.99 (increased depth as a competitive response)"
    - "Bud Light Lemon Lime 12C +$2 to $29.99 (end SCO mitigation)"
    - "Corona 24B +$3 to $50.69"

    BUSINESS CONTEXT:
    Add context where appropriate explaining WHY the change is happening:
    - "increased depth as a competitive response"
    - "end SCO mitigation"
    - Value positioning references (e.g., "Labatt Value at $23.49")
    - Competitive benchmarking (e.g., "Ultra at $58.99")
