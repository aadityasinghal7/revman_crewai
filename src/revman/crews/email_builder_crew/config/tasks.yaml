    Transform the categorized price change data into a complete email with subject line, opening text, and highlights.

    INPUT DATA (provided via inputs):
    - effective_date: {effective_date}
    - price_changes_categorized: {price_changes_categorized}

    INPUT DATA STRUCTURE:
    The input is a FLAT JSON structure with 5 categories (NO brewer grouping yet):
    {{
      "LICENSEE CHANGES": [...list of all licensee products...],
      "NEW SKUs": [...list of new SKU products...],
      "Permanent Changes": [...list of retail products with 96-104% price ratio...],
      "Begin LTO": [...list of retail products with <96% price ratio...],
      "End LTO": [...list of retail products with >104% price ratio...]
    }}

    YOUR JOB:
    1. Take "LICENSEE CHANGES" and "NEW SKUs" - keep them as-is (no grouping)
    2. Take "Permanent Changes", "Begin LTO", "End LTO" - group these by brewer using hierarchy below
    3. Build the email output with brewer-grouped sections

    BREWER GROUPING RULES (applies ONLY to "Permanent Changes", "Begin LTO", "End LTO"):
    For each product in these categories, determine which brewer it belongs to:
    - LABATT: Budweiser, Bud Light, Stella Artois, Corona, Modelo, Becks, Hoegaarden, Michelob, Mill St, etc.
    - MOLSON: Coors, Molson Canadian, Miller, Heineken, Creemore, etc.
    - SLEEMAN: Sleeman, Sapporo, Colt 45, etc.
    - Other: Laker, Peroni, James Ready, Moosehead, Guinness, Steam Whistle (retail), Muskoka, Beaus, Faxe, Gone Fishin, Longhorn, Rough Stock, and all others not in above categories

    CRITICAL: Do NOT use placeholder values or make up data. Use ACTUAL DATA from the input.

    REQUIRED STRUCTURE:
    1. Subject Line: "TBS Price Change Summary – Effective {effective_date}"
       - Use the provided effective_date (extracted from the filename)
       - Consistent format each week
       - Use em dash (–) not hyphen (-)

    2. Opening Text:
       - Brief paragraph providing context about the price changes
       - Reference the effective date
       - Keep it consistent each week

    3. Highlights Section:
       - Title: "Highlights (Price Before Tax and Deposit)"
       - Pack size notation note: "C = 355mL can, TC = 473mL tall can, B = bottle"
       - For each Brewer (LABATT, MOLSON, SLEEMAN, Other) in that order:
       - Brewer name as header
       - "Begin LTO" section (if applicable) - new price < 96% of old price
       - "End LTO" section (if applicable) - new price > 104% of old price
       - "End LTO & Permanent Change" section (if applicable)
       - "Permanent Changes" section (if applicable) - 96% ≤ new price ≤ 104% of old price
       - Empty line between brewers

    4. After all brewers:
       - "LICENSEE CHANGES" section (if applicable) - Type of Sale = TBS - Licensee
       - "NEW SKUs" section (if applicable) - newly added products

    FORMAT EACH LINE:
    Product PackSize +/-$Amount to $FinalPrice

    Examples:
    - "Budweiser 30C -$5.50 to $45.99"
    - "Bud Light Lemon Lime 12C +$2 to $29.99"
    - "Corona 24B +$3 to $50.69"

    FORMAT RULES:
    - Use EXACT format: Product PackSize +/-$Amount to $FinalPrice
    - Do NOT add any business context, commentary, or explanatory notes
    - Present data cleanly without additional interpretation
